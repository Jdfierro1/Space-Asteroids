Hi There,

This is a simple Asteroids game using Python and the Turtle framework. 

I used a python game tutorial from Youtube to help me design this game. 

10/29 Inception
- Created a screen, space ship, enemy and ally out of standard shapes
- added colors to the sprites on the screen
- created physics with collission mechanics and retained characters in the border of the game as opposed to them wandering off in to the void
- created a missile firing mechanic
- keybinds were set on the arrow keys and space bar 

10/30 Update
- Added sound effects when you fire a missile
- Added sound effects for collissions (both space shape, and missile colliding)
- Added scoreboard in the top left and a point system when you shoot an enemy vs an ally

I hope you like it!
