Hi There,

This is a simple Asteroids game using Python and the Turtle framework. 

I used a python game tutorial from Youtube to help me design this game. 

Requirements to run: 
- modern IDE
- Python 3
- The following Python Libraries available and installed on your machine:
- --- os
- --- random
- --- turtle
- --- time

10/31 Update
- Added multiple allies and enemies
- improved FPS drastically
- added explosion visuals when a missile hits an enemy, or when player runs into an enemy
- added a visually appealing background (we are fighting in space after all!) 

10/30 Update
- Added sound effects when you fire a missile
- Added sound effects for collissions (both space shape, and missile colliding)
- Added scoreboard in the top left and a point system when you shoot an enemy vs an ally

10/29 Inception
- Created a screen, space ship, enemy and ally out of standard shapes
- added colors to the sprites on the screen
- created physics with collission mechanics and retained characters in the border of the game as opposed to them wandering off in to the void
- created a missile firing mechanic
- keybinds were set on the arrow keys and space bar 

I hope you like it!
